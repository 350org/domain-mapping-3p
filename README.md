## Domain Mapping is the only plugin of its kind to bundle simple mapping, domain name resale and mapping as a premium service.

As one of the most requested features for Multisite, Domain Mapping has quickly become an essential plugin for every network.

Cut the bulk and display beautiful, memorable URLs across an entire Multisite network.


### Simple Setup, Smart Configuration

Already set up your network? Map domains on a subdomain or subdirectory network. Don't worry about confusing settings. Domain Mapping automatically adjusts to fit your network's structure.

### Sell Domain Names Direct

Become a reseller and open new streams of income. Let users search, buy and map as many domain names to their site as they like. Automate distribution and management with eNom and Pro Sites

Sell domain names right inside your WordPress Multisite dashboard.

Domain Mapping even works with networkwide passwords and global shopping carts.

### Stand Out Performance

Save big on SSL certification with mapping control over individual URLs. Get the only mapping plugin in its class to offer forced HTTPS and to let you use an original URL for things like checkout and payment pages.
